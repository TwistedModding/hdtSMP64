// SMP XML "pattern" expander.
//
// A *pattern* is a reusable, parameterized macro for SMP physics XML. An author defines one once:
//
//     <pattern-default name="cape">
//       <param name="prefix"/>
//       <param name="rows" default="6"/>
//       <body>
//         <repeat var="i" count="${rows}">
//           <bone name="${prefix}_${i}"> ... </bone>
//         </repeat>
//         <repeat var="i" count="${rows}" from="1">
//           <generic-constraint bodyA="${prefix}_${i-1}" bodyB="${prefix}_${i}" template="link"/>
//         </repeat>
//       </body>
//     </pattern-default>
//
// and instantiates it where the real bones/constraints would go:
//
//     <pattern name="cape" prefix="NPC_Cape" rows="8"/>
//
// `expandPatterns` rewrites the document so every <pattern> use becomes the ordinary
// bone/constraint/etc. elements it stands for, and the <pattern-default> definitions are removed.
// Everything downstream (the runtime loader, XSD, Schematron, redundancy analysis) then sees only
// plain SMP elements and needs no knowledge that patterns exist. The five physics-XML parse sites
// each run this in front of their own parser so they all agree on the same expanded reality.

	/// Algorithm:
	///   1. Fast path: if `raw` does not even contain the substring "<pattern", return it unchanged with
	///      no parsing. Almost every existing file takes this path and comes back identical at no cost.
	///   2. Parse `raw` with pugixml (full fidelity: comments, PIs, declaration preserved).
	///   3. Collect every <pattern-default> -- first from `options.libraries` (in load order), then from
	///      the file -- into a registry keyed by namespaced name (author.name) and version; a later
	///      definition of the same key overrides an earlier one (the file overrides a library).
	///   4. Rebuild the tree: copy ordinary nodes through, dropping <pattern-default> definitions and
	///      replacing each <pattern> use with its body -- with ${param} / ${loopVar} / ${loopVar±N}
	///      substituted and <repeat> loops unrolled (nested repeats give 2-D grids).
	///   5. Serialize the rebuilt tree back to text.
	///
	/// Fail closed: an undefined pattern, a missing required parameter, an unknown ${x}, a bad or
	/// over-cap <repeat count>, exceeding the recursion/element caps, or a parse failure all yield
	/// `ok == false` with `xml == raw`.
	PatternExpansion expandPatterns(const std::string& raw, const PatternOptions& options = {});

	/// Convenience overload with no shared libraries -- expands only the file's own patterns.
